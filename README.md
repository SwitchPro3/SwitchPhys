I do commissions, I don't have set rates yet, and I'm willing to be flexible with your budget.
I also do requests, requests come after all commissions and personal works, Don't expect anything done quickly.

My goal is to make as accurate physics as possible and to be accessible to the community. 
In order to do this all my personal work is freely accessible, I DO NOT WANT MY WORK SOLD OR REDISTRIBUTED.
